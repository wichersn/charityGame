The goal is to feed the hungry people. Use the joystick to move and the trigger to shoot food to feed them. Use, button 2 to switch between types of food (shown on the bottom right) and button 3 to pause and see the price of the food. If you feed someone enough, they will be fully-fed and will donate something to your character, either money or a power-up. You pass the level when you fully-feed enough people. Watch out, if too many people die and you run out of lives it's game over. Have fun and Good luck! (press button 2 to continue)
